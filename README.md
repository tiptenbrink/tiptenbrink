Hi, I'm Tip ten Brink.

I am studying for a MSc in Computer Science at the TU Delft, after completing a BSc in Applied Mathematics and a BSc in Applied Physics. I'm interested in scaling distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, high-performance computing, cryptography and mathematical optimization. I also like building useful applications.

- I'm interested in combining the flexibility, ease of use and accessibility of Python and the performance, reliability and soundness of Rust. Thank you to [PyO3/pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) for creating a powerful interface between these two languages!
- I also love the power of the web. For that purpose I'm learning about deployment infrastructure, TypeScript, React and SvelteKit. I'm especially concerned with keeping the web secure, so I like looking into technologies like OPAQUE and general cryptography.
- I like building small tools for useful tasks. For that reason, I am developing [dirgh](https://github.com/tiptenbrink/dirgh) (download a single **dir**ectory from **G**it**H**ub) and [confspawn](https://github.com/tiptenbrink/confspawn) (for generating config files from templates).
