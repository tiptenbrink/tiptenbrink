Hi, I'm Tip ten Brink.

I have a passion for programming and after a Double BSc in Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics I'm pursuing a MSc in Computer Science at the TU Delft.
- I'm interested in combining the flexibility, ease of use and accessibility of Python and the speed, reliability and soundness of Rust. Thank you to [PyO3/pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) for creating a fantastic interface between these two languages!
- I also love the power of the web. For that purpose I'm learning about deployment infrastructure, TypeScript and React. I'm especially concerned with keeping the web secure, so I like looking into technologies like OPAQUE and general cryptography.
- I am quick to make my own tools if my (very) specific use case is not represented by something that already exists. For that reason, I am developing [dirgh](https://github.com/tiptenbrink/dirgh) (download a single **dir**ectory from **G**it**H**ub), [confspawn](https://github.com/tiptenbrink/confspawn) (for generating config files from templates) and other tools, although they are not ready for production use.
